Sinatra - A very simple demo
============================

This is a quick project based off of a [sinatra demo](http://www.slideshare.net/Cannikin/classy-web-development-with-ruby-sinatra-and-heroku-1) I found on slideshare.

It includes:
 - A simple hello world page `hi.rb`
 - A simple email entry form `beta.rb`
 - A simple dynamic url demo `dynamic.rb`

It has some simple erb views in `views/`
